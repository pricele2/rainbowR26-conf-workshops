## Pre-processing

The raw data downloaded from census websites can be found in the [`data/raw-data` folder](https://github.com/nrennie/rainbowR-VisLGBTQ/tree/main/data/raw-data), and the [README](https://github.com/nrennie/rainbowR-VisLGBTQ/blob/main/data/raw-data/README.md) explains where each data set came from. 

The raw data was processed to create the clean data sets in the `data` folder. The processing code can be found in `data/00_clean_data.R`.
