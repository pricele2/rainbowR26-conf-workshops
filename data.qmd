The data has been pre-processed to enable you to focus on visualisation instead of data cleaning.

{{< include data/README.md >}}

## Loading data

You can load the main, pre-cleaned data sets using:

```{r}
#| file: examples/00_load_data.R
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
```

## Raw data sources

### Spatial data

If you want to make maps, you will also need spatial data for the boundaries of the different regions.
